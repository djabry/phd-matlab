GENERAL
=======
MATLAB-CDI is a collection of MATLAB functions that import/read GRIB
and netCDF files through high-level function calls that follows an unified
syntax. The package supports a subset of the full GRIB and netCDF format
specification typically produced by climate models.

Technically speaking, MATLAB-CDI consists of mex-interfaces to the CDI
library that read GRIB/netCDF. CDI is the basic library underlying the
famous CDO (Climate Data Operators) developed by Max-Planck Institut
für Meteorologie in Hamburg. The MATLAB-CDI interface package has been
developed by The MathWorks Consulting on behalf of the Rossby Centre, SMHI.  

MATLAB-CDI has been compiled and tested under Linux and Windows. The
Linux installation is straightforward, while there are pre-compiled mexwin
files available for Windows. If this doesn't work, you may consider
installing the package yourself. However, the Windows installation from
scratch requires experience of how to compile and install programs in a
Linux-like environment such as cygwin or MinGW. (Actually, it's not
the MATLAB-CDI package that causes the problems, it's the netCDF and
CDI libraries that need to be compiled under Windows, nothing for the
faint-of-heart.)





FUNCTIONS
=========
CDI_VARLIST: Returns the list of variables in a netCDF or GRIB file
CDI_READFIELD: Reads a variable from a file
CDI_READMETA: Reads all metadata for a variable in a file and return
   the result in a structure
CDI_READFULL: Reads a single variable and all its metadata from a file,
   the results is a structure
CDI_READALL: Reads all variables and all their metadata from a file,
   the result is a structure array
CDI_DATES: translates the date from CDI native format to true date

All functions have on-line help sections that explain their usage,
simply type 

    help <function> 

from within Matlab.


A note on nametables
--------------------
While netCDF files provide self-contained descriptions of the data in
the file (including type of variable, units, and more), GRIB files
rely on externally defined tables (cf. GRIB 1 documentation in WMO
Manual on codes, FM-92). In the MATLAB-CDI package these external
tables are implemented as nametable files. Such files are only used
for importing GRIB files, as they translate a GRIB description triplet
(CODE,TYPE,LEVEL) to a variable name, together with appropriate units
and a description (long_name). An example of a nametable file for
selected ERA-40 variables is included in the package (filename
nametable_era40.txt). The use of nametables is optional, an empty
string can be given instead.


KNOWN BUGS
==========
Your Matlab session may crash under rare circumstances when using any
of the functions in this package. This happens if your netCDF or GRIB
files does not adhere to the standards, e.g. contains additional
dimensions or grid orientations that are not supported by CDI. 


EXAMPLES
========
Included with this distribution are a GRIB and a netCDF file with a
selection of monthly means for May 2002 from the ERA-40 archive. The
nametable_era40.txt can be used together with the GRIB file to
translate GRIB parameters to human-readable variable names.



INSTALLATION
============
Pre-requisites
--------------
Check if you have the netCDF and CDI libraries on your system (usually
these are called libnetcdf.a and libcdi.a). If not, you need to
install these libraries before continuing.

netCDF: available from http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf
        (matlab-cdi has been tested only with netcdf 3.x, netcdf 4.0
        may or may not work)

CDI:    available from http://www.mpimet.mpg.de/cdi

Install netCDF before installing CDI. If you are on a Linux-like
system, you simply follow the installation instructions in the
packages. Windows users can read below for hints how to install these
packages.

Compilation
-----------
Copy libnetcdf.a and libcdi.a to a directory { lib32 | lib64 |
lib-mingw } depending on your architecture, see compile.m for details.

Start Matlab while in matlab-cdi and run compile. If everything goes
well you will now have mex-files and can start using the functions in
the package. You may want to add the matlab-cdi directory to your
Matlab path.


A few notes on compilation
--------------------------

Linux32:
        netCDF and CDI can be installed right off-the shelf,
        matlab-cdi should not make much of a headache either

Linux64:
        netCDF and CDI need to be compiled with option -fPIC. If you
        forget it, or if you have a pre-installed netCDF nad CDI on
        your system, You may receive a warning during compilation
        (depending on your compiler) or it may fail during runtime.
        Re-compile netCDF and CDI with -fPIC before running compile.

Windows PC:
        You can check if the included *.mexw32 files work. If yes,
        great, you are done. If not, you face some tough work. First
        you need to install a Linux-like environment such as MinGW or
        cygwin:

        Cygwin: available from http://www.cygwin.com
        MinGW: available from http://www.mingw.org

        Follow the installation instructions for the package that you
        have selected.  (Cygwin users: make sure you install the devel
        package.) Once completed, you can continue with the
        installation of netCDF and CDI.

        Cygwin:
                Assume you would like to install the lib directory in
                /cygdrive/d/matlab-cdi-win32. Change accordingly if
                you prefer a different location.

                Configuring netCDF:

./configure CC=gcc CFLAGS=-mno-cygwin --disable-utilities
--disable-f77 --disable-f90 --disable-cxx --disable-examples
--prefix=/cygdrive/d/matlab-cdi-win32

                Configuring CDI:

./configure CC=gcc CFLAGS=-mno-cygwin CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/include
LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib --with-netcdf=/cygdrive/d/matlab-cdi-win32
--prefix=/cygdrive/d/matlab-cdi-win32

        MinGW:
                Assume you would like to install the lib directory in
                /cygdrive/d/matlab-cdi-win32/mingw2. Change
                accordingly if you prefer a different location.

                Configuring netCDF:
./configure --disable-utilities --disable-f77 --disable-f90
--disable-cxx --disable-examples
--prefix=/cygdrive/d/matlab-cdi-win32/mingw2

                Configuring CDI:
./configure --prefix=/cygdrive/d/matlab-cdi-win32/mingw2
--with-netcdf=/cygdrive/d/matlab-cdi-win32/mingw2


        Cygwin and MinGW installation:

        If all went well with the installation of netCDF and CDI you
        will find libnetcdf.a and libcdi.a in the lib directory that
        you have specified with the --prefix option. Copy libnetcdf.a
        and libcdi.a to lib-mingw in the matlab-cdi directory, and
        change their suffix from .a to .lib

        Finally all that is left is to get an appropriate mexopts.bat
        that tells Matlab how to compile c-programs with gcc. You can
        create such a mexopts.bat yourself (recommended) with GNUMEX
        (available from https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnumex and
        then follow the instructions in
        http://gnumex.sourceforge.net/#matlab_steps) or you modify one
        of the the sample gnumex that is enclosed. Copy your
        mexopts.bat to lib-mingw 

        Keep your fingers crossed, start Matlab and run compile.
