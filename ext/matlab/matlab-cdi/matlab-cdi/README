test*.m are test files. They are not necessary for the use of the MEX files.
The libraries provided in /lib32/ and /lib64/ are not products of The MathWorks. They have to be replaced by your own NetCDF and CDI libraries.

How to compile
---------------------

1/ copy your own compiled CDI and NetCDF libraries in the lib32 or lib64 directory if needed or edit the file compile.m and change the compilation line.
These files names should be libcdi.a and libnetcdf.a.
2/ run compile.m in the MATLAB(R) prompt.
It should produce 5 MEX files: cdi_varlist.mex*, cdi_readmeta.mex*, cdi_readfield.mex*, cdi_readall.mex*, cdi_readfull.mex*.

OPTIONS:
In the MEX compilation line,
add the -DDOUBLE flag to return double value for field data returned by cdi_readall, cdi_readfield, cdi_readfull.
By default, they return single value for the data field.
add the -DDEBUG flag to display debug info

How to install
-------------------
After the compilation, only the *.mex* files are necessary to access GRIB/NetCDF files.
Only cdi_varlist.mex*, cdi_readmeta.mex*, cdi_readfield.mex*, cdi_readall.mex*, cdi_readfull.mex* are mandatory for the execution.

cdi_varlist.m, cdi_readmeta.m, cdi_readfield.m, cdi_readall.m, cdi_readfull.m are HELP files.
Typing "help cdi_varlist" in the MATLAB(R) prompt returns the help of this function.

You can compile the MEX files in a directory and add this directory in the MATLAB(R) path so that the CDI functions become global.

Notes
---------

1/ cdi_read1var.c can generate 3 different MEX files thanks to preprocessor definition.
These preprocessor definitions allow to use the very same source code for different MEX files, thus avoid redundant code and ease its maintenance.

2/ The 64 bits CDI and NetCDF libraries have been compiled with the shared library option to get rid of an error during MEX compilation.
for CDI:
./configure CFLAGS=-fPIC CPPFLAGS=-fPIC  --with-netcdf=/mathworks/home/cpouillo/work/netcdf64
make
for NETCDF::
./configure CFLAGS=-fPIC CPPFLAGS=-fPIC --enable-shared
make

The need of this option can depend of the system.

The 5 functions have been compiled and successfully tested with MATLAB(R) 2007a on the following system:
LINUX 32: Red Hat 3.4.6-3 on i386
LINUX 64: Debian 4.1.1-21 on amd64 (CDI and NetCDF libraries compiled with shared option)
